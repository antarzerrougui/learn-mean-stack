###Step 8 - MongoDB:
Saving Data with [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/). MongoDB is a NoSQL or non relational database. It makes SQL and most traditional databases look like an excel spreadsheet. You can store complex objects in Mongodb. Those of you that never worked with old school SQL cannot appreciate it but it is huge advantage
Start by going over the [in browser demo for mongo](http://try.mongodb.org/?_ga=1.263434828.1335229757.1422827841).

Once you feel comfortable you will want to [install MongoDB locally](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads?_ga=1.260764237.1335229757.1422827841) and play around locally.

Finally start playing around with [Mongoose.js](http://mongoosejs.com/), the NodeJS package that we will use to talk to the MongoDB Database. Most of the basics can be covered in their [Getting Started Guide](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html).
