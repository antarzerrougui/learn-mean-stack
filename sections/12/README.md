###Mobile:
For mobile unless you are a purist or your building some fancy 3d grafic processing tool I strongly suggest using modern rapid prototyping tools such as [The Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) (Shout out to Max and Ben at Drifty). Ionic allows you to write your web app in HTML and JavaScript then run them in a Browser window inside of a running app on both iOS and Android(they did support other devices now I am not so sure).


This is possible with the [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) framework. It makes writing these a lot easier.

[PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) takes it a step further by automating a number of the build and deployment processes that you need to do manually with Cordova. Of course they charge a little bit.
