###Hosting/Infrastructure:
I use [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/) or AWS because I have working with them for the better half of a decade.
I even started to build my own informational product around AWS.
There are plenty of other good ones to learn but AWS is pretty amazing once you get your head wrapped around it.
