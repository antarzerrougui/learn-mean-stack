Since I am not going to even try and compete with the sheer amount of free tutorials on the web and I often use the exact same tutorials as a reference as I build my projects I will now refer you to a series of web tutorials.

####Warning:
You might be tempted to get side tracked learning everything these tutorials recomend, that is fine and all but remember I crafted this list to get you to a specific destination, those sites may not have the same destination in mind.


I suggest you start by familarizing your self(NOT MEMORIZING) the [W3 Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/html/]


Stop when you hit the section on **HTML Tables** and return to guide for the next steps, Anything past that is not essential to moving toward the goal of this guide so skip it for now but feel free to come back and study later.
