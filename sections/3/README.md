###Step 3 - JavaScript:
HTML by nature does not have much brains behind it, its purpose is primarily to look display information in a pretty way.
Originally HTML was not really intended to perform logical calculations or be interactive beyond linking to other pages.
Modern HTML/HTML5 has a little but is still limited.

This is where JavaScript comes into play. Javascript allows you to create interactive websites

####JavaScript Fundamentals:
There are a couple of interesting things that make JavaScript as a language unique. If you don’t know anything about programming this will be a difficult thing to wrap your head around. You will have the advantage of not learning it one way and now needing to relearn it. I would say just skip this for now and come back once you have a more advanced knowledge of the language. If you have used other scripting languages then you will want to read up on the following:

#####Scope/Closures:
[Scope](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_scope.asp)
[Closures](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_closures.asp)

#####Non-Blocking/Async:
 Here is a decent post on [Non Blocking Javascript](http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2010/08/10/what-is-a-non-blocking-script/)

####JavaScript in the browser:
Once you are familiar with Javascript fundamentals

###Subsection:
If you haven't used [git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics) yet now is the time to get started. Sign up for a free [GitHub](http://github.com) and start learning. [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics) is a version control language. It is like Google Docs for Code but a little more complex.

One of the big services on the web is [GitHub](http://github.com) which is an amazing tool.

####IMPORTANT NOTE:
 I typically don’t hire any devs that have not published at least something on GitHub. GitHub is like LinkedIn on steroids to developers(at least us open source types. Post anything and everything you are working on, I myself have [a huge list of repos on GitHub](http://github.com/schematical).
