###Step 5 - Advanced Frameworks:
Now it is time to learn a bad ass framework, AngularJS. Angular is a next generation browser based framework for building really interactive web applications.
It is quite powerful.

I suggest you start by following the free tutorial on [The Angular homepage](http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js/level/1/section/2/our-first-controller).

I am surprised by how sad Angulars default tutorials are so I will try and give you some bullet points of what you will need to learn to become proficient.

[Modules](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/function/angular.module)
Basic app setup - `<html ng-app=’yourAppsModuleName’>`
[HTML binding]( https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/databinding)
[Directives](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive) - These are crazy powerful snipits of html
[Controllers](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/controller)
[Services](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/services) - Specifically the all important [ngResource](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource/service/$resource) for calling out to the server

There is a lot more to angular but that is the basics. There are lots of tutorials, most of which were not around when I was learning Angular. I am actually looking to you to help me find some good ones. Send me any recommendations.
