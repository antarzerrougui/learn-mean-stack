###Step 4 - Basic Frameworks:
The next step is to get familiar with one of the tools that can be used to make development easier.
So far in this guide you have been working with basic js.
Almost every major web application uses these **Frameworks** to make development easier.
Each framework does something different. The first framework I will show you is Twitter Bootstrap

####Bootstrap:
As a hardcore hacker type Bootstrap is far from the coolest framework I use on the frontend, Angular is much more interesting.
But because of its graphic nature and their for easier to wrap your head around.

Bootstrap was developed to make building **Responsive** Web Pages. This means a page that will easily resize and fit in smaller browsers like mobile and tablets.
It is primarily a graphical framework though it does have some functional additions and new components that are not available in basic HTML.


Their getting started page is overly complex. To keep from getting overwhelmed I would follow these steps:

* Start with by  [http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#download](Downloading Bootstrap).
* Then set up a [Basic Template](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#template)
* Then skip ahead to the [Css Section](http://getbootstrap.com/css) and work your way forward through the [Css Section](http://getbootstrap.com/css), [Components](http://getbootstrap.com/components/), and the [JavaScript](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/) sections in a linear fashion
